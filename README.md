Author: Julia Bazi≈Ñska 385134

An interpreter of a functional programming language. Implements all the features described in language description, apart from alberaic data types. It has all the features for 25 points and also pattern matching for currently implemented types (Int, Bool, List).
Project structure:
 - `grammar.cf` - language grammar,
 - `language-description.pdf` - description of language features,
 - `src`
    - `Main.hs` - main program, supports file interpreting and reading program from stdin,
    - `Interpreter.hs` - contains all funcitons related to interpreting the language and evaluation, presumes that the typechecking has been already done,
    - `Typecheck.hs` - contains everything needed to do static type checking before interpreting,
    - `parser` - contains files generated by `bnfc` for grammar
 - `tests`
    - `good` - example programs with self-explanatory names,
    - `bad` - various programs with errors.

This is a cabal project, to build use `cabal build` or to run `cabal run`.
